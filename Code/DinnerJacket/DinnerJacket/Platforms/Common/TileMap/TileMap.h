/** 
 @brief Protocol adopted by the object responsible for providing map objects
        (game objects) to populate the tile map.
 
 @details
        The map's symbolic layers contain references to map objects (display 
    hierarchy node subclasses) to be instantiated and placed on the map on 
    initialization. These are specified inside the map file as strings. The data
    source is responsible for deciding which class to instantiate based on that
    string, and provide the instance to the map for placement inside the display 
    hierarchy.

/**
 @brief Sent zero or more times during asynchronous initialization to populate 
        each map layer.
 
 @details
        During map layer initialization, placement information for map objects 
    is read from file. This information consists of an initial position in the 
    layer and an application-specific string (identifier) used to determine 
    which kind of object (e.g. player, coin, enemy, etc.) it should be. The map 
    layer is thus populated with such objects, instantiated and provided on
    demand by the data source.
